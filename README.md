# After Reading Book Club    
After Reading Book Club is a welcoming community of passionate readers who meet weekly to discuss books and connect with fellow book lovers. Our mission is to promote a love of literature, encourage critical thinking, increase imagination and creativity, and cultivate a reading habit in a positive and nurturing environment. We meet once a week to discuss the book of the week, share our thoughts, experiences, and insights on the book, and vote on the next book we will read and discuss. We welcome anyone who loves to read, and we're committed to exploring the potential of books to inspire, challenge, and transform us together as a community.

### Goals and Hangouts
The club seeks to meet new people, share experiences of reading, and choose books that expose members to new ideas, genres, and writing styles. They aim to cultivate a reading habit and encourage members to read more regularly. The club meets every Saturday at 9am at the Hilton Dublin on Charlemont Pl in Saint Kevin's. During meetings, members discuss a carefully selected book of the week, share their thoughts and insights, and vote on the next book to read. The club values the power of literature to enrich lives and welcomes all to join.
