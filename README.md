They aim to cultivate a reading habit and encourage members to read more regularly. The club meets every Saturday at 9am at the Hilton Dublin on Charlemont Pl in Saint Kevin's. During meetings, members discuss a carefully selected book of the week, share their thoughts and insights, and vote on the next book to read.
