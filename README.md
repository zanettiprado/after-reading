When using Safari browser for mobile, the navigation is covered by the backgroud but it does not affect the user experience since logo still being clickable

# Color Scheme 

Blue represents calmness, serenity, and stability. It's associated with the ocean, sky, and water which can create a relaxing environment for readers. It can also help reduce eye strain and fatigue. Incorporating blue into a reading space can be as simple as using blue-hued light bulbs or adding blue-colored accents to the decor. This is the main reason when you open the website the first color you find is blue. I used also light grey to contrast with the blue and you can find a bit of orange in few borders. 

# Typography and Icons 
The fonts were extract from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) I used Assistant and Corter one. Icons from [Fontsawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)



# Deployment
