        <h2> Our Mission:
            <hr>
            <p class="welcome">
                ''Our mission is to create a vibrant community of readers who come together to share our love of books.
                We meet weekly after reading one predetermined book, and aim to read 54 books per year. Our meetings are
                focused on discussing the book, sharing our thoughts and opinions, and connecting with one another over
                our shared passion for literature. <br>

                Through our book club, we hope to encourage reading as a lifelong pursuit, foster meaningful connections
                among our members, and broaden our understanding of the world through the books we read. We believe that
                books have the power to inspire, challenge, and transform us, and we're committed to exploring this
                potential together as a community. <br>

                Whether you're a longtime reader or just getting started, we invite you to join us on this journey.
                Let's discover new worlds and perspectives together, one book at a time.''<br>

                selected in advance. During our meetings, we share our thoughts, experiences, and insights on the book,
                fostering lively discussions that encourage critical thinking and deeper engagement with literature. We
                also take the opportunity to vote on the next book we will read and discuss in the following week,
                ensuring that everyone has a say in what we read next. Our book club is a welcoming and inclusive
                community that values the power of literature to inspire, challenge, and enrich our lives.<br>
